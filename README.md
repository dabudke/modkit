# allydiscord
The open source discord.js bot made by LittleKitacho

## About
Ally is a Discord bot that runs on discord.js, and is owned and maintained by LittleKitacho and a (currently nonexistant) team of developers.  Ally is open source, so make as many forks as you want, and if you wanna improve Ally, just create another branch and pull request.

## Helping out
### Contribute
#### Contribute code
To contribute without becoming a developer, follow these steps.  On GitHub, fork the repository and name it appropriatly.  Clone the new repository to your computer, and open your favorite code editor.  Make your changes, and start a pull request from the master branch of your repository into the master branch of this repository.  The head developers will review them and approve the request if they approve of the changes.
#### Contribute a bug report
If you are reporting a bug, then open an issue here, or report it on the bug reports channel of the discord.  All bugs end up on the issues page here, so before opening a report on the discord or here check the issues page to see if it is a duplicate.  No big deal if you don't see one, we will mark it duplicate if there is a duplicate.
### Become a developer
If you want to become a developer and contribute without doing the above work, head over to the website (kitachoworkshop.wordpress.com/allydiscord), and click the link to the developer application form.  Once you fill out the form, the head developers will review the applications and email you back once we discuss it.
### Become a support member
If you want to become a support member (both in the Discord and here) then head over to the website (kitachoworkshop.wordpress.com/allydiscord) and click the link to the Support team application form.  Fill out the form, and the head developers will get back to you when they can.
