## About Ally

Ally is a Discord bot that is programed in JavaScript.  She uses the library
Discord.js to communicate with the Discord API, and has lots of fun and
useful functions and commands.  She is fully customizable, and can even set
settings for a single user!  Her uses are flexible, and more useful commands
are being added all the time!

Invite Ally to your server by clicking [this link](todo) or running the
command `^invite`.

Ally is licenced under the [`AGPL-3.0-only`](./LICENSE.txt) license.  
Check the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for changes to Ally, the license
and the [security policy](./SECURITY.md).

## Information about Self-Hosting

To self-host Ally, you don't need a very good computer.  Any Raspberry Pi
will do.

To begin self-hosting, followthese steps:

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers)
 and log in with your account.
2. Create a new application, such as `My Awesome Bot`.
3. Go to the bot tab, and create a bot user.
4. Go to the `Ally_vX.X.X` folder and edit the files in the `meta` folder
 with the information required.
5. Run the command `npm install` to install all dependencies.
6. Run `npm start` to start the bot.
